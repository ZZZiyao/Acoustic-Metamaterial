This repository contains the core source code for a deep-learning-assisted acoustic metamaterial design project. The work integrates TensorFlow models (SVM, MLP, CNN) for bandgap and dispersion prediction with CGAN/VAE-based topology optimization, combined with MATLAB and COMSOL for simulation and validation.

Note: COMSOL .mph files and large training datasets are not included due to GitHub file size limits.

This repository is intended for academic and personal use ONLY.
